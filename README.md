# 🧮 Mathematics for Machine Learning — Study Notebooks

Welcome to my **Mathematics for Machine Learning** repository!

In this repository, I’m sharing the **Jupyter notebooks** I’ve created while studying the *Mathematics for Machine Learning* course.  
Each notebook corresponds to a specific session in the course and includes my notes, explanations, and code implementations for better understanding.

## 📘 Repository Overview

- The repository contains notebooks named according to their session number:
  - session-1.ipynb
  - session-2.ipynb
  - session-3.ipynb

- For example, the notebook for Session 2 is: `session-2.ipynb`


Each notebook focuses on different mathematical concepts used in machine learning, such as:
- Linear Algebra  
- Calculus  
- Probability and Statistics  
- Optimization  
- Vector Spaces  
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors  
- and more.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1 — Run on Google Colab
You can open any notebook directly in Google Colab without installation.  
Simply click this badge and replace the filename in the URL with the one you want to open:

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Rahmat-ML/math-for-ml/blob/main/session-2.ipynb)

> Example: change `session-1.ipynb` to `session-2.ipynb` in the URL for the second notebook.

### Option 2 — Run Locally
If you prefer running notebooks on your machine:

# Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rahmat-ML/math-for-ml.git
cd math-for-ml
```

# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

# Install Jupyter
```bash
pip install notebook
```

# Run Jupyter
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open the desired `session-*.ipynb` file.
